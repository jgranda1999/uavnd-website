- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling and responsive design
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **Framer Motion** - Animations (ready to use)

## Design Philosophy

The website combines:

- **IrishSat's Academic Style**: Clean, professional design with Notre Dame branding
- **Anduril's Tech Aesthetic**: Modern dark theme with high contrast and sleek typography

## Customization

### Colors

The website uses a custom color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`:

- `nd-gold`: Notre Dame gold (#D4AF37)
- `nd-blue`: Notre Dame blue (#0C2340)
- `nd-navy`: Notre Dame navy (#1B365D)
- `dark-bg`: Dark background (#0A0A0A)
- `dark-surface`: Dark surface (#1A1A1A)

### Content

Update the content in each component file:
- `src/components/Hero.tsx` - Hero section content and background video
- `src/components/Projects.tsx` - Project information
- `src/components/About.tsx` - About section content
- `src/components/Team.tsx` - Team member information and photos
- `src/components/Sponsors.tsx` - Sponsors content
- `src/components/Outcomes.tsx` - Alumni companies (logos, colored tiles)
- `src/components/Contact.tsx` - Contact information and background video

### Media Assets

- Place images in `src/img/` and import them directly in components.
- Place videos in `src/videos/` and import `.mp4` files directly; TypeScript module declarations are included in `src/types/media.d.ts`.
- Large videos may impact performance; consider compressing or trimming for production.

### SVG Notes

- Some SVGs with XML namespaces (e.g., `xmlns:bx`) may fail to compile in CRA by default. If an SVG fails, either sanitize it (remove non-standard namespaces/attributes) or convert it to PNG.
